heco_3breaker and heco_5breaker are both derived from pnnl_hmi.  pnnl_hmi is a
power distribution management scenario with 7 breakers; heco_3breaker and
heco_5breaker have 3 and 5 of these breakers, respectively. The heco_3breaker,
heco_5breaker, and pnnl_hmi cannot all run at the same time, as they all use
the same infrastructure in the SCADA Master.

| Working with heco_3breaker and heco_5breaker |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that there is still code in place to receive messages from and send
messages to the PLC for the breakers that have been removed; however nothing in
the current system reads or writes to the corresponding memory locations. While
this code could be removed, it is left in the current version, because it can
be re-purposed for easily prototyping new features to extend the HMI.

An example of reading from the incoming data can be seen in mask1_slots.h, in the
slotNullEvent() function.

An example of writing to the PLCs can be seen in mask1_slots.h, in the
slotButtonPressedEvent() function.

Both of these functions read to/write from the data model. An example of how
messages are sent from the data model to the PLCs can also be seen in
slotButtonPressedEvent(), and an example of how messages are read from the
SCADA Master can be seen in master_exec.cpp, in the Process_Message() function.
