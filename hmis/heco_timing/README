This HMI was created in order to test the latency between issuing a command to
a PLC and seeing the result on the display screen. It was used in conjunction
with a RaspberryPi that could independently communicate with the PLC and had a
photoreceptive sensor pointed at the screen. The RaspberryPi issued a command
to the PLC that caused a box on the screen to change color from black to white
(or vice-versa) and then timed how long it took its photosensor to notice the
change.

A similar test could be performed by modifying the HMI itself to issue a
command and then measure the time until it sees a corresponding change in the
data it is reading from the PLC.
